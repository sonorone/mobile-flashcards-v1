# Damian's Mobile FlashCards

This is a React-Native project powered by Expo CLI.

To run the project, make sure you install create-react-native-app CLI using npm or yarn.

You can also use snack.expo.io which is what I used to built this project.

The source code is also in my Github repository:

# Launching the project

GO into the project folder and run `yarn install` or `npm install` to install all dependencies. 

Finally, run the `yarn start` or `npm start` command in the same folder.
